# Astrocrest on OpenVibe

Astrocrest is OpenVibe's operating intelligence — not a client, not a subsidiary. It is the engine that decides where the OS goes next.

Six roles run in the Astrocrest workspace, split across two teams:

**Research team:** Market Scanner, Competitive Intel, Signal Monitor
- Continuously maps professional services sub-segments
- Scores candidates against the 5-dimension framework
- Tracks competitive entries and macro signals

**Lifecycle team:** Incubator, Health Monitor, Portfolio Manager
- Creates new brands from approved sub-segments
- Monitors portfolio health against M3/M6/M12 gates
- Makes enter/hold/scale/exit allocation decisions

**Primary metric:** Flywheel density — the rate at which client referrals compound without active sales.

**Key configs:**
- `config/soul.yaml` — workspace identity
- `config/roles.yaml` — role instantiations
- `config/scoring.yaml` — 5-dimension scoring framework with weights and thresholds

**Platform tenant:** `astrocrest`
**Strategy docs:** `v5/docs/strategy/ASTROCREST.md`, `v5/docs/strategy/INCUBATION-LOGIC.md`, `v5/docs/strategy/OS-MODEL.md`
