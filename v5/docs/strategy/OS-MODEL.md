# OS Model

> OpenVibe is a professional services OS — not a SaaS product, not a holding company.

---

## 1. The Model

Professional services is the last major industry that hasn't been factory-ized. Every billing specialist, marketing agency, and compliance consultant is still running handcraft operations. AI is the factory.

OpenVibe's core asset is not any particular company it creates. It is the **capability to enter any professional services sub-segment** and deliver production-quality work through AI roles faster than any human team could match on cost.

## 2. Three-Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Brand Layer (5-20 visible brands)                      │
│  EduReach · BuildFlow · [future brands]                 │
│  Client-facing, domain-specialized, trust-carrying      │
└─────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                              │
┌─────────────────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│  Sub-segment Layer (1,000+ micro-specialized offerings) │
│  Catholic K-12 · Jewish day schools · [100+ niches]     │
│  Each brand spawns sub-segment products from AI data    │
└─────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                              │
┌─────────────────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│  OS Layer (OpenVibe — never sold)                       │
│  Platform · SDK · Playbooks · Domain memory             │
│  The engine that creates everything above               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why three layers instead of one?**

Trust, distribution, and regulation are domain-specific. A "dental billing specialist" is trusted by dental practices in a way that "AI services company" never will be. Each brand carries domain-specific trust. The OS layer is invisible to clients.

## 3. Sub-segment Selection Framework (5D Scoring)

See `scoring.yaml` for weights. The framework is:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Flywheel Density | 30% | Community tightness, word-of-mouth velocity |
| AI Deliverability | 25% | % of core work AI completes autonomously |
| Pain Urgency | 20% | Budget exists, need acute, timeline pressure |
| Competitive Gap | 15% | No AI-native competitor in this sub-segment |
| Reach | 10% | Accessible via Vibe channels or direct |

**Minimum to enter:** 4.0/5.0

**Top criterion:** Flywheel density. A sub-segment with no tight referral network requires perpetual paid acquisition. That's not a business — it's a treadmill.

---

## 4. Self-Operated vs. Joint Venture

| Criterion | Self-Operated | Joint Venture |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| AI deliverability | > 70% | 40-70% |
| OpenVibe ownership | 100% | Majority (60-70%) |
| Hold horizon | Permanent | Permanent + buyout clause at M18 |
| Human partner | None needed | Domain expert required |
| Examples | Marketing ops, billing, data entry | Legal review, medical coding, architecture specs |

**Buyout clause:** At M18, if JV hits metrics (ARR > $300K, AI deliverability > 70%), OpenVibe triggers buyout at 3x ARR. Human partner exits with a fair return.

**Never exit self-operated companies.** The compounding value is in the domain memory and client relationships. Sale removes both.

## 5. Phase 1 Candidates

**First Brand: EduReach** (Catholic K-12 small schools)
- Sub-segment: Private K-12 with 1-5 member marketing staff, $2-8M budget
- Score: 4.62/5.0 (highest scored sub-segment)
- Distribution: Vibe K-12 channel (4,282 schools with Vibe boards)
- Flywheel: Catholic school administrators have tight diocesan networks + NCEA conference
- AI deliverability: 78% (content creation, email campaigns, enrollment reporting)
- Ownership: Self-operated

**Second target: Jewish day schools**
- Same trust channel, higher average budget, tighter referral network
- Launch M4-6 once Catholic K-12 playbook is validated

**Third Brand: BuildFlow** (AEC — Architecture, Engineering, Construction)
- Launch M6-12
- Vibe's fastest growing B2B vertical (existing relationships)
- AI deliverability: 65% (project documentation, compliance tracking, RFP response)
- Ownership: JV with AEC domain expert

## 6. Vibe Inc as the OS Distribution Layer

Vibe hardware + Workspace is the physical distribution channel into professional environments. 4,282 companies with 1-2 Vibe boards represent the first natural Studio upsell target.

**Trigger logic:**
- User spends > 6h/week on professional tasks in Workspace
- AI modification rate > 40% (they're already getting value from AI assistance)
→ Surface Studio service (EduReach, BuildFlow, etc.) as upgrade

This creates a closed loop: hardware gets the foot in the door, Workspace proves value, Studio delivers revenue. The OS captures margin at all three layers.

**Estimated Studio ARR potential from Vibe base:** $46M (30% conversion × 4,282 companies × $3,600/year average).
